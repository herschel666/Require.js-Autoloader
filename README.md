# Require.js Autoloader

As web-apps grow larger and larger the overhead grows simultaneously. With this example I tried to find an approach to initially load fundamental scripts and to autoload further scripts, when the visitor clicks through the web-app.

I choose jQuery UI for this example &ndash; only the core gets initially loaded. The widgets are loaded by the Autoloader only if necessary.
